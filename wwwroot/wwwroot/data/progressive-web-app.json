The majority of the studies were conducted in the USA (54%). In total, 86% were conducted in high-income countries and the remaining 14% in upper middle-income countries. The most commonly used social media platform was Facebook (39%) with few studies utilising other platforms such as WeChat, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Google Hangouts. Many studies (48%) used web-based communities or apps that mimic functions of these well-known social media platforms. We compared studies assessing interactive social media interventions with non-interactive social media interventions, which included paper-based or in-person interventions or no intervention. We only reported the RCT results in our 'Summary of findings' table. We found a range of effects on health behaviours, such as breastfeeding, condom use, diet quality, medication adherence, medical screening and testing, physical activity, tobacco use, and vaccination. For example, these interventions may increase physical activity and medical screening tests but there was little to no effect for other health behaviours, such as improved diet or reduced tobacco use (20,139 participants in 54 RCTs). For body function outcomes, interactive social media interventions may result in small but important positive effects, such as a small but important positive effect on weight loss and a small but important reduction in resting heart rate (4521 participants in 30 RCTs). Interactive social media may improve overall well-being (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.79, moderate effect, low-certainty evidence) demonstrated by an increase of 3.77 points on a general well-being scale (from 1.15 to 6.48 points higher) where scores range from 14 to 70 (3792 participants in 16 studies). We found no difference in effect on psychological outcomes (depression and distress) representing a difference of 0.1 points on a standard scale in which scores range from 0 to 63 points (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.12, low-certainty evidence, 2070 participants in 12 RCTs). We also compared studies assessing interactive social media interventions with those with an active but less interactive social media control (11 studies). Four RCTs (1523 participants) that reported on physical activity found an improvement demonstrated by an increase of 28 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week (from 10 to 47 minutes more, SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59, small effect, very low-certainty evidence). Two studies found little to no difference in well-being for those in the intervention and control groups (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13, small effect, low-certainty evidence), demonstrated by a mean change of 0.4 points on a scale with a range of 0 to 100. Adverse events related to the social media component of the interventions, such as privacy issues, were not reported in any of our included studies. We were unable to conduct planned subgroup analyses related to health equity as only four studies reported relevant data.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review combined data for a variety of outcomes and found that social media interventions that aim to increase physical activity may be effective and social media interventions may improve well-being. While we assessed many other outcomes, there were too few studies to compare or, where there were studies, the evidence was uncertain. None of our included studies reported adverse effects related to the social media component of the intervention. Future studies should assess adverse events related to the interactive social media component and should report on population characteristics to increase our understanding of the potential effect of these interventions on reducing health inequities.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34057201/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=14spTIXMx9q5VxHL0hF01jcu924nTUk2pU55EcyBHlXK47VgTE&fc=20210928135245&ff=20210928135257&v=2.15.0\">34057201</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8406980/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=14spTIXMx9q5VxHL0hF01jcu924nTUk2pU55EcyBHlXK47VgTE&fc=20210928135245&ff=20210928135257&v=2.15.0\">PMC8406980</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012932.pub2>10.1002/14651858.CD012932.pub2</a></p></div>",

Four RCTs (1523 participants) that reported on physical activity found an improvement demonstrated by an increase of 28 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week (from 10 to 47 minutes more, SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59, small effect, very low-certainty evidence). Two studies found little to no difference in well-being for those in the intervention and control groups (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13, small effect, low-certainty evidence), demonstrated by a mean change of 0.4 points on a scale with a range of 0 to 100. Adverse events related to the social media component of the interventions, such as privacy issues, were not reported in any of our included studies. We were unable to conduct planned subgroup analyses related to health equity as only four studies reported relevant data.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review combined data for a variety of outcomes and found that social media interventions that aim to increase physical activity may be effective and social media interventions may improve well-being. While we assessed many other outcomes, there were too few studies to compare or, where there were studies, the evidence was uncertain. None of our included studies reported adverse effects related to the social media component of the intervention. Future studies should assess adverse events related to the interactive social media component and should report on population characteristics to increase our understanding of the potential effect of these interventions on reducing health inequities.\nPMID:34057201 | PMC:PMC8406980 | DOI:10.1002/14651858.CD012932.pub2",

Neurogenic, inflammatory, endocrine, and metabolic mechanisms have been proposed. Taking into account the temporal dynamics and comorbid mood symptoms of fatigue may help differentiate fatigue phenotypes. These phenotypes may reflect different pathogeneses and may respond to different mechanism-specific treatments. Although several tools have been developed to assess various symptoms (including fatigue), monitor clinical status, or improve the perceived level of fatigue in patients with MS, options for a detailed, real-time assessment of MS-related fatigue and relevant comorbidities are still limited.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present a novel mobile app specifically designed to differentiate fatigue phenotypes using circadian symptom monitoring and state-of-the-art characterization of MS-related fatigue and its related symptoms.

In total, 64 patients with MS were recruited into this study and asked to use the app over a 2-week period. The app features the following modules: Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) to assess circadian changes in fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain; daily sleep diaries (SLDs) to assess sleep habits and quality; and 10 one-time questionnaires to assess fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleepiness, physical activity, and motivation, as well as several other one-time questionnaires that were created to assess those relevant aspects of fatigue that were not captured by existing fatigue questionnaires. The app prompts subjects to assess their symptoms multiple times a day and enables real-time symptom monitoring through a web-accessible portal.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">RESULTS: Of 64 patients, 56 (88%) used the app, of which 51 (91%) completed all one-time questionnaires and 47 (84%) completed all one-time questionnaires, VASs, and SLDs. Patients reported no issues with the usage of the app, and there were no technical issues with our web-based data collection system. The relapsing-remitting MS to secondary-progressive MS ratio was significantly higher in patients who completed all one-time questionnaires, VASs, and SLDs than in those who completed all one-time questionnaires but not all VASs and SLDs (P=.01).

Taking into account the temporal dynamics and comorbid mood symptoms of fatigue may help differentiate fatigue phenotypes. These phenotypes may reflect different pathogeneses and may respond to different mechanism-specific treatments. Although several tools have been developed to assess various symptoms (including fatigue), monitor clinical status, or improve the perceived level of fatigue in patients with MS, options for a detailed, real-time assessment of MS-related fatigue and relevant comorbidities are still limited.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to present a novel mobile app specifically designed to differentiate fatigue phenotypes using circadian symptom monitoring and state-of-the-art characterization of MS-related fatigue and its related symptoms. We also aim to report the first findings regarding patient compliance and the relationship between compliance and patient characteristics, including MS disease severity.\nMETHODS: After developing the app, we used it in a prospective study designed to investigate the brain magnetic resonance imaging correlates of MS-related fatigue. In total, 64 patients with MS were recruited into this study and asked to use the app over a 2-week period. The app features the following modules: Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) to assess circadian changes in fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain; daily sleep diaries (SLDs) to assess sleep habits and quality; and 10 one-time questionnaires to assess fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleepiness, physical activity, and motivation, as well as several other one-time questionnaires that were created to assess those relevant aspects of fatigue that were not captured by existing fatigue questionnaires. The app prompts subjects to assess their symptoms multiple times a day and enables real-time symptom monitoring through a web-accessible portal.\nRESULTS: Of 64 patients, 56 (88%) used the app, of which 51 (91%) completed all one-time questionnaires and 47 (84%) completed all one-time questionnaires, VASs, and SLDs. Patients reported no issues with the usage of the app, and there were no technical issues with our web-based data collection system. The relapsing-remitting MS to secondary-progressive MS ratio was significantly higher in patients who completed all one-time questionnaires, VASs, and SLDs than in those who completed all one-time questionnaires but not all VASs and SLDs (P=.01). No other significant differences in demographics, fatigue, or disease severity were observed between the degrees of compliance.\nCONCLUSIONS: The app can be used with reasonable compliance across patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive MS irrespective of demographics, fatigue, or disease severity.\nPMID:33861208 | PMC:PMC8087974 | DOI:10.2196/19564",

The \"PowerApp\" allows to measure mechanical power at a glance during mechanical ventilation, without complex mathematical computation, and making mechanical power equation useful and feasible for everyday clinical practice.\nPMID:33559781 | PMC:PMC7871299 | DOI:10.1186/s40635-021-00372-0",

The brain has a high content of cholesterol and the metabolism of cholesterol in the brain can be associated with beta-amyloid plaques formation, which is seen in Alzheimer's disease.

Certain mutations in the brain cholesterol transport receptors and proteins and their association with Alzheimer's were also studied. This systematic review abides by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched multiple databases, such as Pubmed, Google Scholar, Pubmed central, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Medline with the help of keywords like Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, plasma lipid biomarkers, cholesterol, brain cholesterol metabolism separately and in combination with each other. We collected 49 quality appraised articles on the association between plasma lipids and Alzheimer's disease and the genetic mutations in alleles related to cholesterol metabolism and Alzheimer's disease by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on the finding of the studies reviewed, we found an association between plasma lipids, polymorphisms in genes associated with cholesterol transport, and Alzheimer's disease. Increased serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), sphingolipids, 24S hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), 27O hydroxycholesterol (27O-HC) was associated with Alzheimer's. Decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and phospholipids were noticed. Genetic mutations in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein A (ApoA), ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette transporter 7 (ABCA7), amyloid precursor protein (APP), cytochrome P450 family 46 subfamilies A member 1 (CYP46A1), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) are also associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. This study found an association between plasma lipids and Alzheimer's, proving that plasma lipids can be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
